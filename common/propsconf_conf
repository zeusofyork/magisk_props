# =================================================================
# ========================== Instructions =========================
# =================================================================
# Set the above variables to the desired prop/configuration values.

# If any variables are left unset, that particular prop/configuration
# will be cleared and the device/Magisk default values will be used.
# If you want to keep any current module settings (for those that
# aren't true/false options), add "preserve" to the variable.
# Example:
# CONFFINGERPRINT=preserve

# When placed in the root of your internal storage (/sdcard), in /data
# or in /cache (or /data/cache if you're using an A/B device), the module will load these
# values during boot and the configuration file will be deleted. Keep a backup of the
# file if you want to reuse it at a later time (clean ROM flash, etc).

# For more information, see the documentation:
# https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md
# and the support thread @ XDA Developers:

# =================================================================
# =========================== Variables ===========================
# =================================================================
# CONFFINGERPRINT should be set to the fingerprint of a ROM that passes
# the ctsProfile check. See the prints.sh file for usable prints,
# or the documentation for information on how to find one.
# Note that Android builds after March 16 2018 often also need to match the Android
# security patch date. Add the date to the end of the fingerprint, preceeded by
# two underscores (example: __2018-10-05), or use the CONFPROPS setting
# to set ro.build.version.security_patch to the matching date (example: 2018-10-05).
#
# Changing CONFVENDPRINT to 'true' will enable using the stock vendor
# fingerprint for Treble GSI ROMs (so only us this if you're on a Treble GSI ROM).
# NOTE! Keep in mind that there is no need to enter a fingerprint in
# CONFFINGERPRINT when enabling this option, or setting a security patch date.
#
# CONFPRINTBOOT is by default set to using the module default boot stage for setting props.
# If the setting is changed to "post" or "late", the props will be set during either
# post-fs-data or late_start service mode. This is useful if props don't seem to set
# propely or the module's boot script seems to be causing issues during boot.
#
# CONFPATCHBOOT is by default set to using late_start service boot stage for setting
# ro.build.version.security_patch. If the setting is changed to "default" or "post",
# the prop will be set during either the default or post-fs-data stage. The
# late_start service boot stage is used by default as to not cause issues for devices with
# Keymaster 4 (bootloops). If the prop doesn't seem to set properly, try changing the stage.

# CONFBASICATTEST is used to enable Forced BASIC attestation, which is done by changing the
# variable to 'true'. To set a custom value, change CONFBASICATTCUST to the value you want.
# Example:
# CONFBASICATTCUST="randommodelname"

# CONFDEVSIM and the following CONFBRAND, CONFNAME, CONFDEVICE, CONFRELEASE
# CONFID, CONFINCREMENTAL, CONFDESCRIPTION, CONFDISPLAY, CONFSDK, CONFMANUFACTURER and CONFMODEL
# are used to set a number of props to simulate a certain deviced based on the fingerprint used.
# CONFDESCRIPTION will automatically be applied if a fingerprint is set
# by the module, but the other props will only be set if CONFDEVSIM is
# set to true, and the default setting for all props are that they will be
# set by the module. If you want to change this, change "true" to "false"
# for the applicable variables.
#
# CONFPARTPROPS is used to enable or disable using partition specific version of the simulation props.
#
# CONFSIMBOOT is by default set to using the module default boot stage for setting props.
# If the setting is changed to "post" or "late", the props will be set during either
# post-fs-data or late_start service mode. This is useful if props don't seem to set
# propely or the module's boot script seems to be causing issues during boot.

# The MagiskHide prop variables, CONFDEBUGGABLE, CONFSECURE, CONFTYPE, CONFBOOTMODE, CONFMODE,
# CONFVENDORMODE, CONFHWC, CONFHWCOUNTRY, CONFSTATE, CONFVERIFIEDBOOTSTATE, CONFVENDORVERIFIEDBOOTSTATE,
# CONFLOCKED, CONFVERITYMODE, CONFBOOTWARRANTY_BIT, CONFBIT, CONFVENDORBOOTWARRANTY_BIT,
# CONFVENDORWARRANTY_BIT and CONFVENDORDEVICE_STATE can be either enabled or disabled (enabled by default).
# If set to true, these props will be changed known safe values if found to contain sensitive values.
# Helps with hiding root.

# CONFPROPS should contain any custom props and the value you want the module to set.
# Any props you've previously edited in build.prop, and more, can be set like this.
# Add them to the CONFPROPS variable according to the following example:
# CONFPROPS="
# ro.sf.lcd_density=320
# ro.config.media_vol_steps=30
# net.tethering.noprovisioning=true
# "
# Please observe that if the prop you're trying to set contains spaces, you'll
# need to replace those spaces with "_sp_" (without the quotation marks).
#
# If you want a specific prop to run in either post-fs-data or late_start service,
# use either CONFPROPSPOST or CONFPROPSLATE instead. Any props added to CONFPROPS
# will run in the boot stage currently set in the module options (see CONFLATE below).
#
# The CONFPROPSDELAY option is used to set a delay for when a specific custom prop is set. Will automacially
# set the prop during the late_start service boot stage. The syntax is as follows:
# Follow the same instructions a for the CONFPROPS variable above to set up the props with the desired values.
# Then append the time in seconds, preceeded by a semicolon. To make the delay wait for
# "Boot completed" also append the word boot, preceeded by two underscores. If the delay is
# supposed to execute instantly, don't add anything after the desired time. Example:
# CONFPROPSDELAY="
# ro.sf.lcd_density=320;10__boot
# ro.config.media_vol_steps=30;20
# "
# In the example above, the density prop will be set 10 seconds after "Boot completed", and the volume steps prop
# will be set 20 seconds after the script is executed in the late_start service boot stage.
#
# With PROPOPTION you can decide if the current custom prop list should
# be replaced, added to or preserved. Add the corresponding words "replace",
# "add", or "preserve". The default option is to replace the list.
# This option supersedes the preserve option described above, but only
# for the CONFPROPS variables.

# CONFDELPROPS is a list of props you want to remove from your system.
# Be very careful when using this option, removing the wrong props might
# cause issues.
# Add the props you want to remove to the CONFDELPROPS variable according to
# the following example:
# CONFDELPROPS="
# ro.sf.lcd_density
# ro.config.media_vol_steps
# net.tethering.noprovisioning
# "
#
# With DELPROPOPTION you can decide if the current custom prop list should
# be replaced, added to or preserved. Add the corresponding words "replace",
# "add", or "preserve". The default option is to replace the list.
# This option supersedes the preserve option described above, but only
# for the CONFDELPROPS variable.

# The soft rebooot options can be set to true if you need a soft reboot at the
# end of the boot process when props are set during the late_start service boot stage.
# CONFOPTIONSOFTBOOT, CONFPRINTSOFTBOOT, CONFPATCHSOFTBOOT, CONFSIMSOFTBOOT,
# CONFCUSTOMSOFTBOOT and CONFPROPSOFTBOOT can be set to "true" or "false".

# CONFBOOT is by default set to using the module system.prop file for most props.
# If the setting is changed to "post" or "late", the props will be set during either
# post-fs-data or  late_start service mode. This is useful if props don't seem to set
# propely or the module's boot script seems to be causing issues during boot.
#
# CONFCOLOUR, CONFWEBP, CONFWEBP, CONFUPDATE and CONFBACK are the options for scrit colours,
# automatic fingerprints list update, moduel update check, automatic update of the set fingerprint and
# background execution of the post-fs-data.sh boot script.
# See the module documentation for more details. Set to "true" or "false".
